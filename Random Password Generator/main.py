# Eli Robison, Random Password Generator

"""
OVERVIEW:
Create a program that allows a user to specify password requirements (length,
upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters) then gives them 4 possible
passwords they could use. 

PROJECT STEPS:
A main function that runs the code
Functions for the different password requirements
A function that assembles that password once it is the correct length
Users should be able to specify length and if they want to include
    uppercase letters
    lowercase letters
    numbers
    special characters
HINT: You can make this by randomly selecting from different lists OR by randomly
generating the ASCII letters!
